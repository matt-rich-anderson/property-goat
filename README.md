Property Goat is a web-based app designed to help small-scale residential property managers better perform their day to day tasks with a helpful set of features. Let's take a look...

## **The Dashboard**
Upon successful login, a user will be taken to their Dashboard. Here they will see all of the properties they have previously created or they will see a prompt to create their first property if they are a new user. 

###***If at any time the user wishes to return to their dashboard, they can click the 'Property Goat' logo in the navigation bar.***

## **Property Details**
If the user wishes to view the details of a particular property, they should click anywhere on the property's card. They will be taken to a details page that displays:
1. Basic property information, including owner
2. Dynamically updated lease information
3. A list of all notes created for the property (along with options to edit or delete said note)
4. A button that deletes the whole property from the user's property list.
The user can return to their dashboard by clicking the PG logo at the top of their screen.
