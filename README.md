Property Goat is a web-based app designed to help small-scale residential property managers better perform their day to day tasks with a helpful set of features. Let's take a look...

## **The Dashboard**
Upon successful login, a user will be taken to their Dashboard. Here they will see all of the properties they have previously created or they will see a prompt to create their first property if they are a new user. 

***If at any time the user wishes to return to their dashboard, they can click the 'Property Goat' log in the navigation bar.
